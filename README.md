# Traffic_light_controller
Digital circuit, Verilog, RTL level

The source codes "Traffic_light_controller_**RTL_...**" are describing traffic light controller on RTL level and consists of:
1) not gate; 
2) counter;
3) 2 comparators;
4) sum circuit;
5) moore machine;
6) ALU (data path).
1-4 modules are part of PWM generator. 

The source code "Traffic_light_controller_**RTL_for_testing**" IS NOT intended for implementation becouse contain additional top module outputs are intended for top module testing by Waveforms.

The source code "Traffic_light_controller_**RTL_for_implementation**" IS intended for implementation becouse test outputs was removed.

The source code "Traffic_light_controller_**HIGH_LEVEL**" is describing traffic light controller with highest level Verilog constructions.
